## Build and Register an MXNet Image Classification Model via SageMaker Pipelines 

This architecture describes how to: (1) preprocess an image (.jpg) dataset into the recommended RecordIO input format for image classification, (2) train and evaluate a MXNet binary image classification model using SageMaker, and (3) register the trained model to SageMaker Model Registry. Additionally, this pattern demonstrates how all these ML workflow steps can be defined and automated using SageMaker Pipelines.
